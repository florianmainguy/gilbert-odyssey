There are 2 main views, the **Race** view and the **Cyclist** view. 
The **Race** view zooms on the race and the interface shows data about the overall best winners, the full history and the elevation profile. From then you can click towards another race with the arrows, or click on a cyclist name. 
The **Cyclist** view shows a picture of the cyclist, its Monument wins and a summary of its wins with icons you can click on, that bring different color for better visualisation. From then you can click on a race name or search for another cyclist through the search box.
